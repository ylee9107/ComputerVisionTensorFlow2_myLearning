# Modern Neural Networks

## Introduction

This project aims to explore more on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and its concepts or building blocks, that was expanded from Fully-connected networks, for the purpose of tackling computer vision tasks or problems. This notebook will demonstrate building a CNN with the TensorFlow API (as well as the Keras API). It will also explore the modern methods on training the model to improve its robustness in practice.

## Breakdown of this Notebook:
- CNNs concepts.
- CNNs' relevance for Computer Vision Tasks.
- Implementation of CNNs in TensorFlow and Keras.
- Advanced optimisers and training of CNNs in an efficient manner.
- Regularisation methods to prevent overfitting.

## Requirements:
- Tensorflow 2.0
- Keras (but the tf.keras version, not the standalone Keras library)
- Scikit-image

## Summary:

From this project, I was primarily able to learn and develop my skills in creating the convolutions blocks of the CNN from scratch. This inherently also improved my understanding with OOP style of programming. There were also several implementations of the network such as in TF, Keras Sequential and Functional APIs. I was able to cover the fundamentals of the CNN architecture, such as the convolutions, max/avg pooling, and the effective receptive fields. This project also covered modern techniques, such as different types of optimisers and regularisation methods to improve the CNN's performance and prevention of overfitting on the dataset.
