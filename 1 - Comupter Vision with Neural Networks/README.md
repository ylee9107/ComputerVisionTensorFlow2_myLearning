## Introduction:

This project will cover what neural networks are and its implementation in Python for the tass of basic recognition. This project will also explore the domain of computer vision and how it is an automation of extracting information from digital images. There are a lot of applications for computer vision such as control systems to be used in industry, facial filters in mobile apps, or security surveillance systems.

Computer vision can also be broken down into the following:
- Content recognition (Object Identification, Object detection and localisation, Object and instance segmentation or Pose estimation).
- Video analysis (Instance Tracking, Action recognition, Motion estimation).
- Content-Aware image edition.
- Scene Reconstruction.

## Breakdown of this Notebook:
- Biological neuron and its mathematical model
- Building an ANN from scratch

## Dataset:

The dataset can be obtain from the link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST Digits dataset contains 70,000 greyscale images that have 28 x 28 pixels for each of the image. This dataset has been a reference set over the last few years to test and improve methods for this recognition task. The Input vector for the network works out to be 28 x 28 = 784 values and it has an output of 10 values (where there are 10 different digits ranging from 0 to 9). Further, the number of hidden layers for this network will be up to the modeller. 

## Summary:

This project ventures into building a neural network from scratch and I am able to appreciate its framework and how it works. I was able to learn and further develop my current understanding in neural networks, where more specifically, the Object oriented programming side of the network itself. Further explorations can consist of experimenting with the hyperparameters, like layer sizes, learning rate, batch sizes and activation functions, to tune the model to perfrom much better.
